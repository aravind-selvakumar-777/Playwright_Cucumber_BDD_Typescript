# Playwright + TypeScript + Cucumber BDD Automation Framework

This repository contains an end-to-end test automation framework built using **Playwright**, **TypeScript**, and **Cucumber**. It allows you to write readable, maintainable, and scalable tests with a BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) approach.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or later) - [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) - npm comes with Node.js
- **Playwright** - Web automation library
- **Cucumber** - BDD testing framework

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aravind-selvakumar-777/Playwright_Cucumber_BDD_Typescript.git
    cd Playwright_Cucumber_BDD_Typescript
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Playwright requires browser binaries. Install them by running:

    ```bash
    npx playwright install --with-deps
    ```
Currently we only use chrome browser for execution.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, simply execute the following command:
```
npx run test
```
By default, it runs in Headless mode. If you want to view the browser exection, set option {headless:false} under src/support/world.ts :
Replace line 11 with: this.browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: true });

Happy Testing :)
